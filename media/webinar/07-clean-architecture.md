# Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that promotes the separation of concerns by dividing software systems into multiple layers, each with a specific responsibility. The primary goal of Clean Architecture is to make a system maintainable and flexible over time. It is especially useful for large-scale applications that require ongoing development and maintenance.

At the heart of Clean Architecture is the principle of decoupling. This means that each layer of the application should be independent of the others, so that changes made in one layer don't impact the others. This separation of concerns is essential for creating a system that is easy to understand, test, and modify.

There are several layers in a typical Clean Architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for handling user input and output. It consists of UI components such as web pages, views, and controllers. This layer communicates with the Domain layer through interfaces and is responsible for translating user input and output into domain concepts.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: This layer is responsible for providing the technical details of the system. It includes components such as databases, external services, and the file system. This layer is responsible for providing implementations for the interfaces defined in the Domain layer.

- **Domain Layer**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It is responsible for the entities, use cases, and domain services of the system.

- **Main Layer** This layer coordinates the interaction between the other layers. It is responsible for starting up the application and wiring the different layers together. It may contains the dependency injection code that glues the different layers together.

One of the benefits of Clean Architecture is that it allows for flexibility and adaptability. Because each layer is independent, changes can be made in one layer without affecting the others. This means that the system can be modified and updated without risking the stability of the entire application.
