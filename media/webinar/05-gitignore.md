# Gitignore

The .gitignore file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This is useful when working on projects with files that should not be committed to version control.

When you add files to your .gitignore, Git will no longer track them or include them in commits. This can be helpful for files that are generated automatically by your project, such as log files or compiled binaries.

Here are some examples of files and directories that you may want to ignore in your projects:

- **node_modules/**: Node.js packages installed via npm or yarn
- **.env**: Environment files containing sensitive information
- ***.log**: Log files generated by your project

It's important to note that the .gitignore file only applies to untracked files. If you've already committed a file to Git, adding it to your .gitignore file will not remove it from your repository. You'll need to manually remove the file from your repository with git rm to completely delete it.

To create a .gitignore file, simply create a file named .gitignore at the root of your project and list the files and directories you want to ignore, one per line. Here's an example:

```Bash
touch .gitignore
echo 'node_modules' > .gitignore
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
```
